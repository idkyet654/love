                    <p>My Sip of cold water in a scorching summer day, Happy birthday you beautiful soul</p>
                    
                    <p>I wish more than anything in this entire world that I could've been with you today and hand you a gift, see your smile in person and hear your laugh right next to me. But since I cant (YET IT'LL CHANGE IDC), I wanted to give you something with words (also cuz I cant let someone else write u a letter and I dont you're literally mine aint no one gonna treat u better than I do) but also because sometimes words are the only way I know how to show what I feel.</p>
                    
                    <p>And there's so much I feel.</p>
                    
                    <p>I want you to know. like REALLY know, that you are one of the kindest, softest and most genuinely pure people I have ever come across. From the way you care about your little sister to how you light up when you see something cute or funny to how you get shy when someone says something sweet. Every little piece of you makes the world better, just by being here.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your heart is gold Jess. Not the kind that needs attention but the quiet kind the steady kind the kind that people feel safe with even if they dont know why.</p>
                    
                    <p>And somehow, even through a screen even from far away you've made me feel seen , calm , and warm. Like a safe place exists and it has your name written all over it.</p>
                    
                    <p>I dont think you realize how much light you carry. I know that LOGICALLY you cant be a star but fuck physics and fuck logic you are my sun. You shine brighter than any sun could ever hope to shine. You think when I call you soft like its something small. But your softness is actually your strength. Your way of loving, of noticing things, of being unapologetically you. Thats rare my love and I am lucky to even witness it.</p>

                    <p>So on your birthday, I hope you feel celebrated and not because its a tradition fuck traditions. But because the world genuinely is better with you in it. You deserve the kind of love you so effortlessly give everyone else. And I'll keep reminding you of that for as long as im around.</p>

                    <p>So I hope today and every day of your life feels like warm sun and ligh laughter. I hope you're spoiled with joy, and I hope you know that somewhere out there, someone is thinking of you with a very full heart. (that someone is me btw)</p>

                    <p>Happy birthday my love, I am so so so soooooo glad you exist ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
